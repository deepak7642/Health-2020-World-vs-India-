# WHO - Health-2020-World-vs-India-
These are more than 30 datasets cover the most recent and updated health statistics of the world (countries recognized by WHO- all). They are divided into different subcategories. In order to capture the theme of World vs India,

I have tried to visualise the data by generalising the plots into 2 main category -

* World demographics on a timeline

* World vs India trend

#### Refer my notebook link (for visuals) : http://localhost:8889/notebooks/Desktop/DSP/D%20kaura%20projects/My%20Own%20Projects/WHO%20-%20Health%202020%20(World%20vs%20India)/Health%202020%20(India%20vs%20World%F0%9F%8C%8F).ipynb

#### Your feedbacks are always welcome they means alot to me and they will help me for improvisation !!!!!
